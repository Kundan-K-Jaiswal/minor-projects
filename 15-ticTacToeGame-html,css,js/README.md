# Tic Tac Toe Game ðŸŽ®

Here I have built two modes for the game :

1. Classic Mode:
  This is simple mode that we use to play on regular basics.

2. Advance Mode:
  Here, in this mode after 5th move the initial move is delected/removed which means the that space becomes empty and we can play our next move there. 

Also, there is a change theme option which helps us change the theme color form blue to green.

There is reset as well as play again button for there respective works.


While building I got to know there is always something new to learn also I enjoyed building this minor project. You can play the game either by accesing this folder through navigator page whose link is given in this repo description or simply by cloning this folder on your system.
