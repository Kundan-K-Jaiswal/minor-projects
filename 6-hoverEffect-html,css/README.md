# Z-Index & Hover Magic ðŸª„ðŸ”®

In this folder I have built a page which contains five(5) images: hovering over it brings it forward and its size increases.

This was possible with the help of "z-index" & "hover" property in the CSS. I have simply assigned z-index value of the images to maximum among them (ie. 10) inside a hover block. Also, I have used transition property for the smooth transition of the images when hovered.
