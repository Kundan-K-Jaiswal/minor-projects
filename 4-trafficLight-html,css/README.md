# ðŸš¦Creating Traffic Light Using CSS Animations

Here in this repo I have tried to build a basic Traffic Light which changes its light in every two second ( red -> yellow -> green ) using html and simple css animation property. Here, is the thought process for this small project...
<br>
Setting the animation time of 6second for each light
<li>setting first 1/3 part of time for red background & rest for grey</li>
<li>setting first & last 1/3 part of time for grey background & rest for yellow</li>
<li>setting first 2/3 part of time for grey background & rest for green</li>
This way we can achieve the traffic light effect.
