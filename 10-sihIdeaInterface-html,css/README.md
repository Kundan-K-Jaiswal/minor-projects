## 💪 Objective / Problem Statement : Learn Constitution in a Simpler Manner

I bulit this simple interface for our SIH Project to present it in the selection round. Since, I was not ready with JS so I didn't used it in making this project. Our idea was to train the AI with the Constitution's norms in such a way that It would reply to the problem of the user with step wise solution. 

💥 For Example : If someone's phone is stolen and now he don't know what he should do next inorder to get his phone back and not fall in any criminal acts if his phone is used in any such activities. Now our app/website comes in action, he/she will explain the stituation to our AI and our AI would response inorder to help him/her.

Also our app/website would contain games for the younger ones which will help them to understand  constituation in a simpler manner. 


## 🗂️ Index Page 
It is simply a dashboard for the app/website which have sign-in and log-in button. Also it has
a section for the fun facts about the constitution and current affairs across the world. Following up with the fun facts section this page have a contact section.


## 🪵 Log-In & Sign-In Page
As the name suggest this are the pages for creating a new account or accessing the existing account.


## 📃 Interface Page
