# ðŸ’²Currency Converter ðŸ’µ


This currency converter website simply uses API to get the exchange rate and then using simple mathematical calculation we find out the respective amount.


This project helped me understand about the API, how to properly use them, how to extract the useful data from the json file and many more. Building projects makes me more comfident and also I get to know if I had understood their use properly or not.
