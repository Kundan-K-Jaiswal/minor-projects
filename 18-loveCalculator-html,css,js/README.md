# ðŸ’˜ Love Calculator


Out of nowhere I remembered how we used to calculate the love percentage with our crush names during our childhood then I though why not create it digitally by my own learnings.


## How it works ?

1. In the very first step we take two names from the user.
2. Then we count the frequency of letters from left to right.
3. After this, once we get all the numbers we start adding the first number with the last number one by one.
4. We repeat the 3rd step again and again until we get a two digit number.
5. The final two digits becomes the love percentage ðŸ’˜.
