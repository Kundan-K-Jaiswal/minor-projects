# ðŸ”ƒ Loading Animation

In this folder I have built a page which contains two loading animations.
<li>Rectangular Bar</li>
<li>Circular Loading</li>


Rectangular Bar:

Here, to buid this I have used two divs, one for the border/container and other for showing progress.






Circular Loading:

Here, I have used a single div to create this effect.
